david knoerr said the performance felt like three adult wise women performing.  It felt in contrast to a lot of dance that seems like really self absorbed in a way and it seemed strikingly absent of a kind of narcissistic self-absorption.  It made want to be present. 

                         It includes the world.  It's about something greater than yourself.
